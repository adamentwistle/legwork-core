"""Shared helpers for the legwork scripts.

Stdlib only, like everything under core/ and suite/. The runner and the
dashboard builder both parse the same project-file shape (frontmatter, the
Next prompt fenced block, dated values), and the runner and installer share
the same config-file KEY=VALUE rules, so that parsing lives here once instead
of being copied into each script. This module is the shared base of the whole
dependency graph: core/ scripts sit beside it (sys.path[0] covers a direct
run), and the suite/ scripts and the installer put core/ on sys.path before
importing it: suite imports from core, never the reverse. Keep this module
dependency-free and free of suite/ imports.
